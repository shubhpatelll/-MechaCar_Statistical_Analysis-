# Solution to AutosRUs’ production issue

## Introduction
AutosRUs’ is a car manufacturing company. AutosRUs’ newest prototype, the MechaCar, is suffering from production troubles that are blocking the manufacturing team’s progress. Therefore, the data analytics team is going to review the production data for insights that may help the manufacturing team.

In this work, the data analytics team do the following:

* Perform multiple linear regression analysis to identify which variables in the dataset predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes.
* Collect summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots.
* Run t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population.
* Design a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers. 


## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
### About Data
The MechaCar_mpg.csv dataset contains mpg test results for 50 prototype MechaCars. The MechaCar prototypes were produced using multiple design specifications to identify ideal vehicle performance. Multiple metrics, such as __vehicle length, vehicle weight, spoiler angle, drivetrain__, and __ground clearance__, were collected for each vehicle. The first ten rows of the data set is shown below:

### Multiple Linear regression on to predict MPG
The multiple linear regression equation was generated by considering the __mpg__ as the dependant variable and the __vehicle length, vehicle weight, spoiler angle, drivetrain__, and __ground clearance__ as independant variables. The results are shown below:

Therefore, the equation of the multiple linear regression is:

   mpg = 6.23*vehicle_length + 0.00125*vehicle_weight + 0.069*spoiler_angle + 3.55*ground_clearance - 3.41*AWD - 104.
   
   
__As the next step, the summary table was obtained and it is shown below:__

<img width="466" alt="Screen Shot 2023-01-08 at 11 12 47 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/112113327/211240054-55633d04-918f-442b-aead-3cb9f4f299d7.png">

According to the summary statistics, __ONLY__ p-values of vehicle length, ground clearance and the intercept are smallar than even 1% significance level. Therefore, those variables are statistically unlikely to provide random amounts of variance to the linear model and hence they provide significance impact on miles per gallon (mpg) of the vehicle. Other three variables are redundant in this model.

   It can be observed that the intercept is statistically significant on the __mpg__. That means there may be some other variables and factors that contribute to the variation in __mpg__ that have not been included in our model.
   
   In addition to the p-values, the coefficient of determination (r - squared value) is 71%. Therefore, the 71% of the predictions using this model would be accurate and hence the slope of the model can not be equal to zero.

### About data
The MechaCar Suspension_Coil.csv dataset contains the results from multiple production lots. In this dataset, the weight capacities of multiple suspension coils were tested to determine if the manufacturing process is consistent across production lots.

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
### Total summary data table
First, a total_summary dataframe was created to get the mean, median, variance, and standard deviation of the suspension coil’s PSI column. The resluts from the summary table is shown below:

   <img width="418" alt="Screen Shot 2023-01-09 at 12 25 48 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/112113327/211246675-7697a868-8105-4b26-8e02-d1b63f0bc37b.png">

The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. According to the summary table, the variance is 62.29 PSI and which is less than 100. Therefore, the current manufacturing data meet this design specification for all manufacturing lots in total.

### Lot summary data table
However, it can be observed that the data is from three different lots. Therefore, the data was grouped according to the group number and then the mean, median, variance, and standard deviation of the suspension coil’s PSI column computed for each group to see the consistancy between groups. The summary table is shown below:

   <img width="614" alt="Screen Shot 2023-01-09 at 12 29 04 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/112113327/211247563-3b64b0c3-86a2-4956-ae6a-c03ff6ecc31b.png">

According to the summary table, the variance for the lot 1 is 0.97 PSI and the variance for the lot 2 is 7.42 PSI. However, the variance for the lot 3 is 170.29 PSI and which is greater than 100. Therefore, the current manufacturing data meet this design specification for SOME manufacturing lots, but not all. This implies that the current manufacturing data does not meet this design specification for each manufacturing lot individually. 


## T-Tests on Suspension Coils
In this section, a t-test was performed at the beginning to determine if all manufacturing lots are statistically different from the population mean of 1,500 pounds per square inch. The test results are show below. Note that the __log10__ transform was used to obtained more accurate solutions to avoid any skewness of the data.

### t-test (three lots vs population)
<img width="539" alt="Screen Shot 2023-01-09 at 9 48 06 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/112113327/211339879-6687bc3b-82fa-4ed0-8351-b18a81e1d3dc.png">


According to the test results, the p-value is greater than 0.05. Therefore, it suggests that "fail to regect the null hepothesis" with 0.05 confidence level. That means there is no statistically significant difference between the true mean and the mean of the manufacturing lots.

In the next step, three t-tests were performed to determine if each individual manufacturing lot is statistically different from the population mean of 1,500 pounds per square inch. Note that the __log10__ transform was used to obtained more accurate solutions to avoid any skewness of the data.

### t-test (lot 1 vs population)
First t-test was performed to determine whether the mean of the lot 1 is statistically different from the population mean of 1,500 pounds per square inch. The results are shown below:

<img width="536" alt="ttest_lot1" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/112113327/211346955-5e9d3f9c-0923-4676-b0eb-7dd3ea42705d.png">

In this test, the p-value is approximately equal to 1 and hence the two means are statistically similar.



### t-test (lot 2 vs population)
The second t-test was performed to determine whether the mean of the lot 2 is statistically different from the population mean of 1,500 pounds per square inch. The results are shown below:

<img width="544" alt="ttest_lot2" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/112113327/211362673-772157b0-5091-49b9-81af-6738c2f06ed8.png">

In this test, the p-value is equal to 0.61 and it is greater than 0.05 significance level. Hence the two means are statistically similar.



### t-test (lot 3 vs population)
Last, t-test was performed to determine whether the mean of the lot 3 is statistically different from the population mean of 1,500 pounds per square inch. The results are shown below:

<img width="537" alt="ttest_lot3" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/112113327/211363837-f30c762e-1c36-4123-a950-7f90f1eeec97.png">

In this test, the p-value is equal to 0.04 and it is smaller than 0.05 significance level. Hence the two means are statistically significant different. In otherwards, this lot have deviated from the regular requirements of the company even though the first two lots are within the requirements. 


## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition
If the manufacturer of the MechaCar vehicles wishes to compare and contrast their product with another competitor, we first need to look at the data that we have in ready to use. The data from the "MechaCar_mpg.csv" provides the information about __vehicle length, vehicle weight, spoiler angle, drivetrain, ground clearance__, and __mpg__. Also, The MechaCar "Suspension_Coil.csv" dataset contains the results from multiple production lots. In this dataset, the weight capacities of multiple suspension coils were tested to determine if the manufacturing process is consistent across production lots.

First and most important thing to compate between two products is the gas millage. To test that we need at least the gas milage of the competior for the comparson. Once we get the data, we can use a __pair t-test__ to compare samples from two different manufactures (populations) as two-sample t-tests are flexible and can be used to compare two samples, each from a different population.

In a paired t-test, the means are determined from the difference between each paired observation. In this case, we use the difference between __mpg__ values of data from two different manufactures. As a result of this, t-test hypotheses are as follows:

* H0 : The difference between paired observations is equal to zero.
* Ha : The difference between paired observations is not equal to zero.

Once we have data, we can rund the t-test and find out any significance differences between two products.

Also, we have observed that the vehicle length and the ground clearance have a significant impact on vehicle millage. Therefore, it will be helpfull to collect vehicle length and ground clearance and test them using a pared t-test.

Finally, if more data is available, more t-tests can be done for the variables vehicle weight, spoiler angle and  drivetrain as well.
